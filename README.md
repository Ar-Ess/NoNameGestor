# No Name Gestor
--------------------------------------
No Name Gestor is an application to manage, in a simple and easy way, your actual monetary situation, arrears and future income.
Its main focus is to categorize your total economic amount into small sections to organize your personal expenses and savings.

This project uses SDL loop application system and ImGui as a Graphic library in charge of the UI.

No Name Gestor is a high scalable project single-developed, which its main focus is features and usage. Nowadays it lacks the UX and
for sure it will be redesigned.

On the top left corner of the window, under the "File" menu, there will be 3 options: Save, Save As & Load.
 - Save: Writes back on the loaded file. If there isn't a loaded file, functions as a "Save As".
 - Save As: Opens a file dialog to search for a path to save your file. If a file is loaded, it creates a new one.
 - Load: Opens a file dialog to search for an existent ".nng" file to open in the program.
